  Creates a Kanboard project with tasks from a JSON file.
  
  If a task owner is not an assignable Kanboard user, the
  project owner will be added as a project-manager and will be
  the owner of the task.
  
  project_file: The JSON file describing the project
  
  kb: The Kanboard instance to use 
  
  identifier: A unique identifier for the project.
  if identifier is not supplied, no identifier will be set for
  the project. Of a project with the identifier exists, it will
  not be created.

  project_owner: The Kanboard username of the owner of the project.
  If not set, the owner will be the Kanboard username in the field 'owner'
  in the project_file. If the owner is not a valid Kanboard user, the project
  will not be created. If owner is not a Kanboard user (or it is not set)
  the project will not be created.
  
  project_title: The title of the project.
  If unset, it will be read from the field 'title' in the project_file.

  project_description: The description of the project.
  If unset, it will be read from the field 'description' in the project_file.

  task_owner: Username of a Kanboard user to own all tasks.
  If not set, the owner will be the owner defined for the task in the
  project_file. If no owner is defined, or the owner name does not match
  a Kanboard user, the task will be the project owner.
  
  due_date = The due date of the project as a datetime.date object.
  If a task definition in the JSON file has a value in the field 'due_date'
  the value must be an integer. If it is negative, the due date of the task
  is x days before the project due date. If it is positive, the due date
  is x days after the project due date. If the due date of any task is
  after the project due data, the project due date will be set to that date.

  roles: A dictionary with roles as keys, and users as value.
  Using roles, you can have an owner set as "ROLE_MANAGER" in the JSON file
  and match that role with a user (Known only by the script).
  {'ROLE_MANAGER': 'user_a', 'ROLE_BUTLER': 'user_b'}. A role
  is signified by prefing the role name with 'ROLE_'
