  project_file: The JSON file describing the project

  identifier: A unique identifier for the project.
  if identifier is not supplied, no identifier will be set for
  the project. Of a project with the identifier exists, it will
  not be created.

  project_owner: The Kanboard username of the owner of the project.
  If not set, the owner will be the Kanboard username in the field 'owner'
  in the project_file. If the owner is not a valid Kanboard user, the project
  will not be created. If owner is not a Kanboard user (or it is not set)
  the project will not be created.

  If unset, it will be read from the field 'title' in the project_file.
  
  task_owner: Username of a Kanboard user to own all tasks.
  If not set, the owner will be the owner defined for the task in the
  project_file. If no owner is defined, or the owner name does not match
  a Kanboard user, the task will be the project owner.

  the value must be an integer. Of it is negative, the due date of the task
  is x days before the project due date. If it is positive, the due date
  is x days after the project due date. If the due date of any task is
  after the project due data, the project due date will be set to that date.
